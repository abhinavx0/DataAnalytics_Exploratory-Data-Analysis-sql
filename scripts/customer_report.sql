Purpose:
- This report consolidates key customer metrics and behavioral insights.

Highlights:
1. Retrieves customer demographics and transactional data.
2. Segments customers into:
   - Engagement tiers: VIP, Regular, New
   - Age groups: Under 20, 20â€“29, ..., 50+
3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
   - Total orders
   - Total sales
   - Total quantity purchased
   - Total distinct products
   - Lifespan (in months)
4. Calculates KPIs:
   - Recency (months since last order)
   - Average Order Value (AOV)
   - Average Monthly Spend
